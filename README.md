Here is the scheme of this app to better understand its functionality:

And here is the list of all endpoints with role required for access and their short description:
- POST: /register - (all) - register as a new user.
- GET: /cinema-halls - (user/admin) - get a list of all cinema halls.
- POST: /cinema-halls - (admin) - create a new cinema hall.
- GET: /movies - (user/admin) - get a list of all movies.
- POST: /movies - (admin) - create a new movie.
- GET: /movie-sessions/available - (user/admin) - returns available movie sessions for specified movie and date.
- POST: /movie-sessions - (admin) - create movie session.
- PUT: /movie-sessions/{id} - (admin) - update movie session.
- DELETE: /movie-sessions/{id} - (admin) - delete movie session.
- GET: /orders - (user) - get list of orders for current user.
- POST: /orders/complete - (user) - create a new order for current user (transfer movie tickets from shopping cart to order and clear shopping cart).

- GET: /shopping-carts/by-user - (user) - get shopping cart of current user.

As you can see above this app has currently only two roles: user and admin. User role is assigned automatically to every new user created.  
User and admin roles as well as user with role admin are created by config/DataInitializer if they are missing in db.

### ðŸ“‚ Project has the following structure:

#### java/

- config -contains config classes required by Spring & Hibernate.
- controller -all http controllers.
- dao -classes responsible for crud operations with db.
- dto -dtos that are used for http requests and responses.
- exception -custom exceptions.
- lib -custom validators for email, password and confirm password.
- model -model classes for entities shown in scheme above.
- service -classes that are responsible for business logic and connecting dao with controllers
- service/mapper -mappers that are used to parse dto to entity and entity to dto.
- util -util class containing date pattern to parse date from json.

#### resources/
- db.properties -file containing database and Hibernate properties.

#### other
- Pom.xml -contains maven build configs and dependencies.
- Procfile and system.properties are needed for proper heroku deployment.

### ðŸ”¨ Technologies used

Java 17, Spring Web MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySql, Tomcat, Maven.
